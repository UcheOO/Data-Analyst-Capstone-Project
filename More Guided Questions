Guiding Questions

What tools are you choosing and why?

I am using R. I am using R because of the large amount of dataset and to work effectively.

Have you ensured your dataâ€™s integrity?

Yes, the dataset has identical columns.

What steps have you taken to ensure that your data is clean?

I converted some columns, so that I would be able to merge it. Next, I remove the NA data/not needed columns.

I filter out the started_at data that are less than the ended_at data, then I create two new columns and named them ride_length and day_of_week.

Next, I formatted the ride_length column to hour, minutes, and seconds.


Have you documented your cleaning process so you can review and share those results?

Yes, all document are store in R markdown.
