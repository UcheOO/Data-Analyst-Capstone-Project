Cyclist Data Analysis
Google Data Analytics Capstone Project: How does a bike-share navigate speedy success?
I've been working on the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate through Coursera. This capstone project is the final project in my Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate course. In this case study, I will be analyzing a public dataset for a fictional company provided by the course. I will be using the R programming language for data analysis and Tableau for visualizations.
About the company
In 2016, Cyclistic launched a successful bike-share offering having a fleet of 5,824 bicycles that are tracked and locked into a network of 692 stations across Chicago. The bikes can be unlocked from one station and returned to any other station in the system at any time.
Riders who have an annual subscription are called members while riders who are single-ride or full-day pass users are considered casual riders.
The director of marketing is looking to maximize the number of annual memberships as they are more profitable than single-ride or full-day passes. This strategy is believed to be the key to future growth.


The following data analysis steps will be followed:

Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyze, Share, Act.


ASK

The questions that need to be answered are:

How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?

Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships?

How can Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to become members?
